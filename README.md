# DeFi Smart Contract Challenges(zoocino)

Welcome to my repository of DeFi smart contracts! 🚀

Here, I’ll be sharing the smart contracts I’ve studied and built as part of my learning journey in decentralized finance (DeFi). The goal is to help you get familiar with different types of DeFi programs and smart contract patterns.

## About the Repository
This repository contains a collection of Solidity smart contracts designed to showcase various DeFi concepts. Each contract comes with a challenge for you to explore. The challenges are beginner-to-intermediate level, so I encourage you to try them out, whether you're new to Solidity or looking to sharpen your skills.


good luck with the challenges! 🦕🐛
